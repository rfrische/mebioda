Metabarcoding
=============

General workflow of metabarcoding assays
----------------------------------------

![](metabarcoding.png)

- **sequence pre-processing**, e.g. de-replication, filtering low-quality and overly 
  short reads, trimming low-quality ends, merging pairs. Using generic 
  [HTS tools](../w1d2/lecture1.md).
- **demultiplexing**, e.g. to split by sampling locations and/or times. Done, for example,
  with [QIIME](http://qiime.org/), [OBITools](https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools/wikis/home)
  or [mothur](https://www.mothur.org/)
- **clustering** using tools such as [CD-HIT](http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/),
  [UCLUST](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/uclust_algo.html), or
  [OCTUPUS](http://octupus.sourceforge.net/)
- **outlier detection**, e.g. chimeric sequences or singletons
- **taxonomic assignment**, e.g. by [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) 
  searches against reference databases, or with [usearch](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/)
  or [vsearch](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)
- **phylogenetic analysis**, e.g. phylogenetic placement, computation of diversity metrics
- **comparing treatments**, e.g. by rarefaction of OTU tables

Species identification of gut contents of permafrost grazers
------------------------------------------------------------

- ancient DNA sequencing of the gut contents of permafrost grazers
- two chloroplast markers (_rbcL_ and _trnL-trnF_) amplified with forward and reverse
  primers
- findings corroborated with morphological analysis of macroremains and pollen

Analysis workflow:

1. demultiplex on IonTorrent adaptors; Phred quality (Q20) and length (>=100bp) filter
2. cluster reads with [CD-HIT](http://www.bioinformatics.org/cd-hit/)
3. BLAST against NCBI _nr_

- c. 10,500 years ago, [Chuckchalakh lake](https://goo.gl/maps/ykG5NpsFceS2), Russia
- Remains of shrubs (_Alnus_, _Betula_, _Salix_) and Poaceae indicate that the animal 
  probably lived in a landscape of predominantly dry soils, intermixed with wetlands 
  containing herbaceous plant species, as indicated by remains of _Comarum palustre_, 
  _Caltha palustris_, _Eriophorum_, _Sparganium_, _Menyanthes trifoliata_ and 
  _Utricularia_.
- All recorded taxa still occur in the present-day Yakutian tundra vegetation.

Joining CITES listing with species detection in organic mixtures
----------------------------------------------------------------

a tool for automated detection of illegally traded species from high-throughput 
sequencing data. _BMC Bioinformatics_ **15**:44 
doi:[10.1186/1471-2105-15-44](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-15-44)

First, species from the [CITES appendices](https://www.cites.org/) are joined with the 
species in the [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) using the 
[GlobalNames taxonomic name resolution service](http://resolver.globalnames.org/api).
A simple request to this service would be:

```bash
curl -o globalnames.json http://resolver.globalnames.org/name_resolvers.json?names=Homo+sapiens
```

Which results in a large [JSON file](globalnames.json). In a script, you might process 
such data as follows:

```python
# doing a single request to the globalnames service
# usage: tnrs.py 'Homo sapiens'
import requests, sys
try:
	url = 'http://resolver.globalnames.org/name_resolvers.json'
	response = requests.get(url, params={'names':sys.argv[1]}, allow_redirects=True)
	json = response.json()
except:
	json = []

if 'results' in json['data'][0].keys():
	if 'name_string' in json['data'][0]['results'][0].keys():
		for data_dict in json['data']:
			for results_dict in data_dict['results']:
				if results_dict['data_source_title'] == 'NCBI':
					print( results_dict['taxon_id'] )					
```

Using this logic, a file-based database is populated:

Comparing treatments: metabarcoding the Deepwater Horizon oil spill

Deepwater Horizon sampling design
---------------------------------

A study using 454 data processed with the QIIME pipeline. With these data the assumption 
was that the reads are structured according to the following primer and amplicon construct:

![](qiime/qiime-primer_construct.png)

In this case with data with the following experimental design:

- sampled over two points in time (pre- and post-spill);
- in 7 localities (Bayfront Park, Shellfish Lab, Ryan Ct, Cadillac Ave, Dauphin Bay, 
  Belleair Blvd, Grand Isle), mostly in the vicinity of 
  [Mobile, Alabama](https://goo.gl/maps/3XgxRk9P1Wk)
- sequencing two markers 
  ([regions of the 18 S gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18S_ribosomal_RNA)) with two 
  primers (respectively F04/R22, NF1/18Sr2b)

Oil spill impact: dramatic shifts in benthic microbial eukaryote communities
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accordingly, the reads were demultiplexed following 
[this complex mapping](qiime/qiime-mapping.tsv). The reads were then clustered with
[UCLUST](https://www.drive5.com/usearch/manual/uclust_algo.html) and denoised. Finally,
taxonomic identification of each cluster was performed using MegaBLAST, resulting in a
[sample by taxon table](qiime/qiime-samples.tsv) alternatively visualized as follows:

Phylogenetic diversity
----------------------

To quantify the turnover between sites and treatments, it is useful to compute metrics
of phylogenetic β diversity, such as UniFrac.

![](unifrac-ab.png)

Squares, triangles, and circles denote sequences derived from different communities. 
Branches attached to nodes are colored black if they are unique to a particular 
environment and gray if they are shared. 
- **A** Tree representing phylogenetically similar communities, where a significant 
  fraction of the branch length in the tree is shared (gray). 
- **B** Tree representing two communities that are maximally different so that 100% of 
  the branch length is unique to either the circle or square environment. 

![](unifrac-c.png)

- **C** Using the UniFrac metric to determine if the circle and square communities are 
  significantly different. For _n_ replicates (r), the environment assignments of the 
  sequences were randomized, and the fraction of unique (black) branch lengths was 
  calculated. The reported _P_ value is the fraction of random trees that have at least 
  as much unique branch length as the true tree (arrow). If this P value is below a 
  defined threshold, the samples are considered to be significantly different. 

![](unifrac-d.png)

- **D** The UniFrac metric can be calculated for all pairwise combinations of 
  environments in a tree to make a distance matrix. This matrix can be used with standard 
  multivariate statistical techniques such as UPGMA and principal coordinate analysis to 
  compare the biotas in the environments.

Constructing a large metabarcoding phylogeny
--------------------------------------------

![](cluster.png)

- A common approach is to align ribosomal RNA against the [SILVA](https://www.arb-silva.de/)
  reference database (in this case using [PyNAST](http://biocore.github.io/pynast/)) and
  infer a tree (e.g. with [FastTree](http://microbesonline.org/fasttree/))
- This tree then becomes the input tree for the Unifrac distance calculations (β 
  diversity), resulting in a distance matrix
- From the distance matrix, a tree can be clustered that, in this case, shows the similarity
  among the post-spill sites

Principal Coordinate Analysis
-----------------------------

![](pcoa.png)

- Because the Unifrac distance matrix is multidimensional, methods to reduce 
  dimensionality (e.g. to 3D) such as PCoA, to explore and to visualize similarities or 
  dissimilarities of data. It starts with a similarity matrix or dissimilarity matrix 
  (= distance matrix) and assigns for each item a location in a low-dimensional space, 
  e.g. as a 3D graphics
- The 2D visualization broadly shows the same as the environment clustering: post-spill
  sites are similar to one another.
